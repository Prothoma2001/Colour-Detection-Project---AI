# Colour-Detection-Project---AI
Colour detection is necessary to recognize objects. Using colours the computers can detect scenery or situation too. It is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps. Colour blind people can also use it to detect colours and work on it. Using this project, we can detect colour names and their RGB value from any picture.
